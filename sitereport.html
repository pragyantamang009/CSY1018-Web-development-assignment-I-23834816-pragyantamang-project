              <div class="text">  <p> AT first making a website was very hard because of what website should make and it was hard because choosing color was the hardest part but design and layout were simple. this website has 5 pages i.e home portfolio contact work experience and site report. the home page was the hardest because it was my first time making a website need a lot of experience for this website layout design and color were already planned but making a website was difficult because what layout design and color were planned it's not going according to plan. while spending a lot of time on this website a little bit of progress was made. but making another page was so much fun it can't describe it in words.

             <div class="text"> AT last, I would like thank to my teacher for giving me this assignment. because of this, I know my level of coding. at first, it was hard for me for making a website because of this assignment I have made a little bit of progress on how to make a website. I know how to make responsive animation and many things because of this assignment. I know that coding is not simple and by doing websites I have gained a little bit of experience.</div>
